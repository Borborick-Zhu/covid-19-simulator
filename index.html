      <h1> COVID-19 Simulator</h1>
      <p>
        The aim of this simulator is to model a COVID-19 outbreak within a closed environment where people are individually roaming around. 
        This simulation is based off the SIR model and takes into account the partial immunity gained from initial infection. This model also takes 
        into account the efficacy of vaccines and the effects of masking on COVID transmission. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This first simulation shows the transmission and recovery in a closed room where people are randomly moving around. Although this rarely occurs, 
        this model can vagely model the spread of COVID-19 in schools and crowded areas where people stay for longer than 2 weeks.
